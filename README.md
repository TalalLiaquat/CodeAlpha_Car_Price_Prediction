## 📚 Project Overview  

This project uses a **car dataset** to:  
- Predict resale values of cars using **Linear Regression**  
- Perform **data preprocessing & scaling**  
- Visualize **feature importance & residuals**  
- Demonstrate **real-world ML applications** like car dealerships, marketplaces, banks, and insurance companies  

The project demonstrates the use of **Python for Machine Learning & Data Science** with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- Load car dataset from **CSV**  
- Clean and preprocess data (missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling)  
- Train **Linear Regression model**  
- Evaluate using **MAE** & **R² Score**  
- Visualize **residuals** and **feature importance**  
- Save cleaned dataset for future use  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered  

- Data Cleaning (handling nulls, encoding categorical variables)  
- Feature Scaling (Standardization)  
- Train-Test Split & Model Training  
- Evaluation Metrics (**MAE, R²**)  
- Data Visualization (**Residual Plot, Feature Importance**)  
- File handling with Pandas (`.csv`)
